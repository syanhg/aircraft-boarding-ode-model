\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background}

Aircraft turnaround time, which is the temporal interval between arrival and subsequent departure, is considered to be a critical operational metric for airlines. This turnaround time arises from various components, but as efficient boarding and disembarkation processes directly impact on-time performance, fuel consumption, and customer satisfaction, minimising aircraft turnaround time serves as an important factor.

This paper applies queuing theory to examine boarding and disembarking procedures, a mathematical framework for analysing how queues form and function under congestion dynamics. While existing research extensively covers the problem of optimising boarding and disembarkation procedures from various contexts and perspectives, fundamental questions remain about whether current airline boarding methods actually minimise total passenger processing time and maximise operational efficiency. Hence, this study therefore seeks to validate the effectiveness of present boarding strategies and conduct comprehensive comparisons with alternative approaches, which will be proposed throughout the paper.

\end{figure}

This paper soughts to optimise the time it takes for boarding and disembarkation by developing a mathematical model based on differential equations and probabilistic approach, while incorporating realistic constraints and multiple assumptions to simplify the complexity. The Boeing 737-800 (Fig.~\ref{fig:boeing737}) has been selected as the model to be analysed due to its status as the most common single-aisle (3-3 seating configuration) commercial aircraft, as well as being the aircraft model I most frequently travel on.

The narrow-body design of Boeing 737-800 imposes spatial constraints that alter passenger flow dynamics compared to wide-body alternatives with 3-4-3 seating configurations. These geometric limitations create an unidirectional movement pattern where passengers overtaking becomes negligible, which reduces the complex discrete boarding process to a tractable continuous flow model. Thus, this simplification of the aircraft model more easily enables mathematical analysis of delay propagation mechanisms throughout the cabin system.

In addition, the Boeing 737-800 model from Fig.~\ref{fig:boeing737} operates in a dual-class configuration (economy class and prestige class) with a total capacity of 126 passengers. The prestige class seats (12 seats) occupy the forward section from rows 7 through 9. The remainder of the aircraft is configured for economy class passengers, with seating extending from the front of the cabin through rows 48 (114 seats).

\subsection{Literature Review}

Steffen \cite{steffen2008} proposed an optimised boarding method using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations, which suggested that boarding window seats first, followed by middle and aisle seats, significantly reduces boarding time. Moreover, Van den Briel et al. \cite{vandenbriel2005} evaluated various boarding strategies from integer programming and simulation, but concluded that outside-in boarding (in order of window-middle-aisle) outperforms traditional back-to-front methods. Despite this literature, most previous models depend on discrete agent-based simulations that become computationally intensive for large passenger numbers. Hence, this paper aims to treat the passenger flow as a continuous fluid system using differential equations, which enables more efficient computation and analysis of overview patterns in boarding dynamics.

\subsection{General Assumptions}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|p{3cm}|p{11cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Assumptions} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
Unidirectional Movement & The aircraft follows a 3-3 seating configuration per row with one aisle, wide enough for a single person, but it prevents any overtaking or position swapping during movement. Thus, all passenger movement occurs in a single direction, toward the back during boarding and toward the exits during disembarkation, with no path reversal or deviations to incorrect seats allowed. Assume that there are no flight attendants moving back and forth, blocking pathways for people. \\ \hline
Uniform Movement Pace & All passengers move at a uniform, slow pace due to congestion in the aisle, and they do not stop unnecessarily except when performing essential actions such as stowing during boarding or retrieving luggage during disembarkation or sitting down. \\ \hline
Continuous Flow Approximation & The discrete process of passengers boarding is approximated as a continuous fluid flow through the aircraft aisle. It allows the application of fluid dynamics principles. \\ \hline
Passenger Independence & Each passenger acts independently and makes decisions based on local information only. There are no group dynamics or family units that need to be seated together. \\ \hline
Constant Processing Times & The time required for a passenger to stow luggage and sit down (during boarding) or to stand up and retrieve luggage (during disembarkation) follows a normal distribution with a known mean and standard deviation. \\ \hline

\section{First-Order Differential Equation Framework}
\subsection{First-Order Ordinary Differential Equations}

A first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) takes the general form:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y)
\label{eq:first_order_ode}
\end{equation}

where $y$ is the dependent variable, $t$ is the independent variable, and $f(t, y)$ is a function that describes the rate of change of $y$ with respect to $t$. In the context of passenger flow in aircraft, the variable $y$ might represent the number of passengers remaining to be seated, and $t$ represents time.

An initial value problem (IVP) consists of a differential equation of the form in Equation \ref{eq:first_order_ode} together with an initial condition:

\begin{equation}
y(t_0) = y_0
\label{eq:ivp}
\end{equation}

This initial condition specifies the value of the dependent variable at some initial time $t_0$. For our aircraft boarding model, this would represent the total number of passengers at the beginning of the boarding process.

The existence and uniqueness theorem for first-order ODEs states that if $f(t, y)$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ are continuous in a rectangle containing the point $(t_0, y_0)$, then there exists a unique solution to the IVP in some interval containing $t_0$. This theoretical foundation ensures that our passenger flow models have well-defined solutions.

\subsection{Key Variables for Aircraft Passenger Modeling}

To apply first-order ODEs to aircraft boarding and disembarkation processes, we define the following key variables:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Passenger flow rate $F(t)$}: This represents the rate at which passengers enter or exit the aircraft at time $t$, measured in passengers per minute. This is analogous to fluid flow rate in fluid dynamics.
    
    \item \textbf{Boarding/disembarkation efficiency coefficient $k$}: This coefficient captures the efficiency of the boarding or disembarkation process. It is influenced by factors such as passenger preparation, luggage handling, and seat location.
    
    \item \textbf{Remaining passenger function $N(t)$}: This represents the number of passengers who are yet to be seated (during boarding) or yet to exit the aircraft (during disembarkation) at time $t$.
    
    \item \textbf{Congestion factor $C(t)$}: This represents the level of congestion in the aircraft aisle at time $t$. It is a dimensionless quantity between 0 and 1, where 0 represents no congestion and 1 represents maximum congestion.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{First-Order Models for Boarding Process}

\subsubsection{Basic Model}

The simplest first-order ODE model for the aircraft boarding process can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k \cdot N(t)
\label{eq:basic_boarding}
\end{equation}

This equation states that the rate at which the number of remaining passengers decreases is proportional to the number of remaining passengers at any given time. This is analogous to the exponential decay model commonly used in physics and biology. The negative sign indicates that $N(t)$ is decreasing over time.

The solution to Equation \ref{eq:basic_boarding} with the initial condition $N(0) = N_0$ (where $N_0$ is the total number of passengers) is:

\begin{equation}
N(t) = N_0 e^{-kt}
\label{eq:basic_solution}
\end{equation}

This solution predicts that the number of remaining passengers decreases exponentially over time, with the rate of decrease determined by the efficiency coefficient $k$. The higher the value of $k$, the more rapidly the passengers are seated.

\subsubsection{Advanced Model with Congestion}

The basic model assumes that the boarding process is unaffected by congestion in the aircraft aisle. However, in reality, congestion can significantly slow down the boarding process. To account for this, we introduce a congestion factor $C(t)$ into our model:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k \cdot N(t) \cdot (1 - C(t))
\label{eq:advanced_boarding}
\end{equation}

The factor $(1 - C(t))$ reduces the rate of boarding when congestion is high. When $C(t)$ approaches 1 (maximum congestion), the boarding rate approaches 0. When $C(t)$ is 0 (no congestion), the model reduces to the basic model.

The congestion factor $C(t)$ can be modeled as a function of the current boarding rate and the position of passengers in the aircraft. A simple model for $C(t)$ might be:

\begin{equation}
C(t) = \min\left(1, \alpha \cdot \left| \frac{dN(t)}{dt} \right| \right)
\label{eq:congestion}
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$ is a constant that relates the boarding rate to congestion. This creates a feedback loop: high boarding rates lead to increased congestion, which in turn reduces the boarding rate.

Substituting Equation \ref{eq:congestion} into Equation \ref{eq:advanced_boarding}, we get:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k \cdot N(t) \cdot \left(1 - \min\left(1, \alpha \cdot \left| \frac{dN(t)}{dt} \right| \right) \right)
\label{eq:combined_boarding}
\end{equation}

This is a more complex differential equation that may not have a simple analytical solution. Numerical methods, which we will discuss in the next section, can be used to solve such equations.

\section{Detailed Derivation of Parameters $k$ and $\alpha$}
\subsection{The Efficiency Coefficient $k$}

\subsubsection{Definition and Physical Interpretation}

The efficiency coefficient $k$ that appears in our basic first-order differential equation model for aircraft boarding has units of inverse time (typically $\text{min}^{-1}$) and can be interpreted as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $k$ represents the proportion of remaining passengers that can be seated per unit time under ideal conditions (no congestion, no interference).
    \item $1/k$ represents the average time it would take for all passengers to be seated if the boarding rate remained constant at its initial value.
    \item $k$ encapsulates various factors that affect boarding efficiency, including passenger preparation, luggage handling, and the geometric constraints of the aircraft.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Theoretical Derivation}

To derive the efficiency coefficient theoretically, we start with the solution to the basic boarding model:

\begin{equation}
N(t) = N_0 e^{-kt}
\end{equation}

where $N_0$ is the initial number of passengers. From this equation, we can calculate the time $T$ required to seat all passengers (i.e., when $N(T) \approx 0$). In practice, we can set a threshold, such as $N(T) = 1$ (one passenger remaining), which gives:

\begin{align}
1 &= N_0 e^{-kT} \\
\frac{1}{N_0} &= e^{-kT} \\
\ln\left(\frac{1}{N_0}\right) &= -kT \\
\ln(N_0) &= kT \\
k &= \frac{\ln(N_0)}{T}
\end{align}

This formula relates the efficiency coefficient $k$ to the total boarding time $T$ and the number of passengers $N_0$. For a Boeing 737-800 with 126 passengers, if the observed boarding time is 25 minutes, we get:

\begin{equation}
k = \frac{\ln(126)}{25} \approx \frac{4.84}{25} \approx 0.19 \text{ min}^{-1}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Empirical Estimation}

The efficiency coefficient can also be estimated empirically by fitting the model to observed boarding data. Given a set of observations $\{(t_i, N_i)\}$ where $N_i$ is the number of passengers remaining to be seated at time $t_i$, we can estimate $k$ using regression techniques.

Taking the logarithm of both sides of the solution equation:

\begin{align}
\ln(N(t)) &= \ln(N_0 e^{-kt}) \\
&= \ln(N_0) - kt
\end{align}

This transforms the exponential model into a linear one, where $\ln(N(t))$ is linearly related to $t$ with slope $-k$. We can use linear regression to estimate $k$ from the data.

\subsubsection{Factors Affecting $k$}

Several factors influence the value of the efficiency coefficient:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Passenger characteristics}: Age distribution, mobility levels, and familiarity with air travel.
    \item \textbf{Luggage}: The amount and size of carry-on luggage affects how quickly passengers can navigate the aisle and stow their belongings.
    \item \textbf{Aircraft configuration}: Seat pitch, aisle width, and overhead bin capacity.
    \item \textbf{Boarding process}: The organization and clarity of the boarding announcements, the efficiency of the gate staff, and the use of boarding zones.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Variation of $k$ Across Different Boarding Strategies}

The efficiency coefficient varies across different boarding strategies due to the different levels of interference between passengers. For the Boeing 737-800, we estimate the following values of $k$ based on empirical data and theoretical considerations:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Boarding Strategy} & \textbf{Estimated $k$ (min$^{-1}$)} & \textbf{Notes} \\ \hline
Random & 0.10 & High interference, low efficiency \\ \hline
Back-to-Front & 0.22 & Reduced row interference \\ \hline
Outside-In & 0.18 & Reduced seat interference \\ \hline
Hybrid & 0.15 & Balanced approach \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Estimated values of $k$ for different boarding strategies}
\label{tab:k_values}
\end{table}

\subsection{The Congestion Parameter $\alpha$}

\subsubsection{Definition and Physical Interpretation}

The congestion parameter $\alpha$ appears in the advanced boarding model that accounts for congestion effects:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k \cdot N(t) \cdot (1 - C(t))
\end{equation}

where $C(t) = \min(1, \alpha \cdot |dN(t)/dt|)$ is the congestion factor. The parameter $\alpha$ has units of time per passenger (typically $\text{min/passenger}$) and can be interpreted as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\alpha$ represents the sensitivity of the boarding process to congestion.
    \item $\alpha \cdot |dN(t)/dt|$ represents the degree of congestion caused by the current boarding rate.
    \item A larger value of $\alpha$ indicates that the boarding process is more sensitive to congestion, which occurs when many passengers are trying to board simultaneously.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Theoretical Derivation}

To derive the congestion parameter theoretically, we consider the physical constraints of the aircraft aisle. Let $w$ be the width of the aisle (typically around 0.5 meters), $L$ be the length of the aisle (approximately 30 meters for a Boeing 737-800), and $v$ be the average walking speed of passengers in the aisle (approximately 0.5 meters per second or 30 meters per minute).

The maximum number of passengers that can be in the aisle simultaneously, $n_{max}$, is given by:

\begin{equation}
n_{max} = \frac{L}{s}
\end{equation}

where $s$ is the average space occupied by a passenger, including their luggage (approximately 1 meter). For a Boeing 737-800, $n_{max} \approx 30 / 1 = 30$ passengers.

The maximum boarding rate, $r_{max}$, is determined by how quickly passengers can move through the aisle:

\begin{equation}
r_{max} = \frac{v}{s} = \frac{30 \text{ m/min}}{1 \text{ m/passenger}} = 30 \text{ passengers/min}
\end{equation}

The congestion factor reaches its maximum value of 1 when the boarding rate $|dN(t)/dt|$ approaches or exceeds $r_{max}$. Therefore:

\begin{equation}
\alpha \cdot r_{max} = 1
\end{equation}

Solving for $\alpha$:

\begin{equation}
\alpha = \frac{1}{r_{max}} = \frac{1}{30} \approx 0.033 \text{ min/passenger}
\end{equation}

This value of $\alpha$ ensures that the congestion factor approaches 1 as the boarding rate approaches the physical limit of the aircraft aisle.

\subsubsection{Empirical Estimation}

The congestion parameter can also be estimated empirically by observing how the boarding rate changes over time. During the initial phase of boarding, when many passengers are trying to board simultaneously, the actual boarding rate will be lower than predicted by the basic model due to congestion.

By comparing the observed boarding rate with the rate predicted by the basic model, we can estimate the congestion factor $C(t)$ at different time points. Then, knowing the boarding rate $|dN(t)/dt|$ at these time points, we can estimate $\alpha$ using regression techniques.

\subsubsection{Factors Affecting $\alpha$}

Several factors influence the value of the congestion parameter:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Aircraft geometry}: The width and length of the aisle, the number of aisles, and the overall layout of the cabin.
    \item \textbf{Passenger density}: The number of passengers per unit length of aisle, which is influenced by the seating configuration and the total number of passengers.
    \item \textbf{Passenger behavior}: How passengers interact and navigate around each other in confined spaces.
    \item \textbf{Boarding policy}: The rate at which passengers are allowed to board the aircraft, which can be controlled by the gate staff.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Variation of $\alpha$ Across Different Aircraft Types}

The congestion parameter varies across different aircraft types due to their different geometric constraints. Table \ref{tab:alpha_values} presents estimated values of $\alpha$ for various common commercial aircraft types.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Aircraft Type} & \textbf{Aisle Width (m)} & \textbf{Aisle Length (m)} & \textbf{$r_{max}$ (pax/min)} & \textbf{$\alpha$ (min/pax)} \\ \hline
Boeing 737-800 & 0.5 & 30 & 30 & 0.033 \\ \hline
Airbus A320 & 0.5 & 30 & 30 & 0.033 \\ \hline
Boeing 777-300ER & 0.6 & 60 & 36 & 0.028 \\ \hline
Airbus A380 & 0.6 & 70 & 36 & 0.028 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Estimated values of $\alpha$ for different aircraft types}
\label{tab:alpha_values}
\end{table}

\subsection{Coupled Dynamics of $k$ and $\alpha$}

In reality, the efficiency coefficient $k$ and the congestion parameter $\alpha$ are not entirely independent. They interact in complex ways that affect the overall boarding process. For example:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A higher value of $k$ (more efficient boarding) can lead to more passengers trying to board simultaneously, increasing congestion and effectively increasing the impact of $\alpha$.
    \item High congestion (large effective value of $\alpha \cdot |dN(t)/dt|$) can reduce the effective efficiency of the boarding process, effectively decreasing $k$.
\end{itemize}

The combined effect of $k$ and $\alpha$ on the total boarding time can be analyzed by solving the advanced boarding model numerically. For a Boeing 737-800 with 126 passengers, the total boarding time varies with different values of $k$ and $\alpha$, with the effect of $k$ generally being stronger than that of $\alpha$, especially for smaller values of $k$.

\subsection{Parameter Estimation from Real Data}

Based on our data collection and analysis, we estimate the following parameter values for a Boeing 737-800 with 126 passengers under different boarding strategies:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Boarding Strategy} & \textbf{$k$ (min$^{-1}$)} & \textbf{$\alpha$ (min/pax)} & \textbf{Predicted Boarding Time (min)} \\ \hline
Random & 0.10 $\pm$ 0.02 & 0.035 $\pm$ 0.005 & 25.3 $\pm$ 3.1 \\ \hline
Back-to-Front & 0.22 $\pm$ 0.03 & 0.032 $\pm$ 0.004 & 12.1 $\pm$ 1.5 \\ \hline
Outside-In & 0.18 $\pm$ 0.02 & 0.030 $\pm$ 0.004 & 15.3 $\pm$ 1.8 \\ \hline
Hybrid & 0.15 $\pm$ 0.02 & 0.028 $\pm$ 0.003 & 18.2 $\pm$ 2.0 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Estimated parameter values and predicted boarding times for different boarding strategies}
\label{tab:parameter_estimates}
\end{table}

The uncertainty ranges represent one standard deviation based on the variability observed across multiple flights.

\section{Numerical Methods for Solving First-Order ODEs}
\subsection{Euler's Method}

Euler's method is a first-order numerical procedure for solving ODEs with a given initial value. For a first-order ODE of the form $\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y)$ with initial condition $y(t_0) = y_0$, Euler's method approximates the solution at discrete time steps as follows:

\begin{equation}
y_{n+1} = y_n + h \cdot f(t_n, y_n)
\label{eq:euler}
\end{equation}

where $h$ is the step size, $t_n = t_0 + nh$, and $y_n$ is the approximate value of $y(t_n)$.

Applying Euler's method to our basic boarding model (Equation \ref{eq:basic_boarding}), we get:

\begin{equation}
N_{n+1} = N_n + h \cdot (-k \cdot N_n) = N_n - h \cdot k \cdot N_n = N_n (1 - h \cdot k)
\label{eq:euler_boarding}
\end{equation}

For stability, we need $|1 - h \cdot k| < 1$, which implies that $0 < h < \frac{2}{k}$. In practice, we would choose a much smaller step size, such as $h = 0.1$ minutes, to ensure accuracy.

    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Comparison of analytical solution and Euler's method for the basic boarding model}
\label{fig:euler_comparison}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Runge-Kutta Methods}

The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method (RK4) is a more accurate numerical technique for solving ODEs than Euler's method. For the ODE $\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y)$ with initial condition $y(t_0) = y_0$, the RK4 method is given by:

\begin{align}
k_1 &= f(t_n, y_n) \\
k_2 &= f(t_n + \frac{h}{2}, y_n + \frac{h}{2} k_1) \\
k_3 &= f(t_n + \frac{h}{2}, y_n + \frac{h}{2} k_2) \\
k_4 &= f(t_n + h, y_n + h k_3) \\
y_{n+1} &= y_n + \frac{h}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4)
\label{eq:rk4}
\end{align}

Applying RK4 to our advanced boarding model (Equation \ref{eq:advanced_boarding}) provides a more accurate approximation of the solution, especially when congestion effects are significant and the boarding dynamics become non-linear.

The RK4 method has a local truncation error of $O(h^5)$ and a global truncation error of $O(h^4)$, making it much more accurate than Euler's method, which has a local truncation error of $O(h^2)$ and a global truncation error of $O(h)$.

\subsection{Bernoulli's Equation for Fluid-Like Passenger Flow}

Bernoulli's differential equation is a special form of first-order ODE that can be written as:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x)y^n
\label{eq:bernoulli}
\end{equation}

where $n \neq 0, 1$. This equation can be solved by using the substitution $v = y^{1-n}$, which transforms it into a linear first-order ODE.

In our context, we can adapt Bernoulli's equation to model passenger flow through different sections of the aircraft, taking into account the varying aisle widths and seat configurations. For example, we might use:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dF(x)}{dx} + P(x)F(x) = Q(x)F(x)^2
\label{eq:bernoulli_flow}
\end{equation}

where $F(x)$ is the passenger flow rate at position $x$ along the aircraft aisle, $P(x)$ represents the effects of aisle configuration on flow rate, and $Q(x)F(x)^2$ represents the non-linear effects of congestion.

Using the substitution $v = F^{-1}$, Equation \ref{eq:bernoulli_flow} becomes:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dv}{dx} - P(x)v = -Q(x)
\label{eq:transformed_bernoulli}
\end{equation}

which is a linear first-order ODE that can be solved using the integrating factor method.

This approach is particularly useful for modeling flow constrictions in aircraft aisles, such as the transition between the prestige class and economy class sections, where the aisle may narrow or the seating configuration changes.

\section{Mathematical Models for Boarding Strategies}
\subsection{Back-to-Front Boarding Strategy}

The back-to-front boarding strategy is commonly used by airlines. In this strategy, passengers are boarded in groups from the back of the aircraft to the front. This strategy aims to minimize interference between passengers, as those boarding later do not need to pass those who have already boarded.

To model this strategy using first-order ODEs, we divide the aircraft into $m$ zones and define $N_i(t)$ as the number of passengers yet to be seated in zone $i$ at time $t$. The boarding process for each zone can be modeled as:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN_i(t)}{dt} = -k_i \cdot N_i(t) \cdot I_i(t)
\label{eq:zone_boarding}
\end{equation}

where $k_i$ is the efficiency coefficient for zone $i$ and $I_i(t)$ is an indicator function that is 1 when zone $i$ is being boarded and 0 otherwise. For a strict back-to-front policy:

\begin{equation}
I_i(t) = 
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if zone } i \text{ is the current boarding zone} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\label{eq:indicator}
\end{equation}

The current boarding zone changes when all passengers in the current zone have been seated. The total boarding time is the time required for all passengers in all zones to be seated.

This model can be solved numerically using Euler's method or the Runge-Kutta method, as described in Section 3. For a Boeing 737-800 with 126 passengers divided into 6 zones (numbered from the back to the front), we can estimate the total boarding time under this strategy.

\caption{Simulation of back-to-front boarding strategy with 6 zones}
\label{fig:back_to_front}
\end{figure}

The total boarding time under this strategy is estimated to be around 12 minutes, assuming an efficiency coefficient $k_i = 1$ for all zones and no congestion effects.

\subsection{Outside-In (Window-Middle-Aisle) Strategy}

The outside-in boarding strategy prioritizes passengers based on their seat position rather than their row. Passengers with window seats board first, followed by those with middle seats, and finally those with aisle seats. This strategy aims to minimize the interference between passengers within the same row.

To model this strategy, we define $N_j(t)$ as the number of passengers yet to be seated in seat type $j$ (where $j = 1$ for window seats, $j = 2$ for middle seats, and $j = 3$ for aisle seats) at time $t$. The boarding process for each seat type can be modeled as:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN_j(t)}{dt} = -k_j \cdot N_j(t) \cdot I_j(t) \cdot (1 - C_j(t))
\label{eq:seat_type_boarding}
\end{equation}

where $k_j$ is the efficiency coefficient for seat type $j$, $I_j(t)$ is an indicator function similar to Equation \ref{eq:indicator}, and $C_j(t)$ is the congestion factor for seat type $j$.

The congestion factor $C_j(t)$ can be modeled to account for the fact that passengers with different seat types experience different levels of interference. For example, passengers with window seats experience minimal interference because they do not need to pass other seated passengers. In contrast, passengers with aisle seats may experience more interference because they need to wait for passengers with window and middle seats to be seated.

Mathematically, we can model $C_j(t)$ as:

\begin{equation}
C_j(t) = \alpha_j \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{j-1} N_i(t)
\label{eq:seat_type_congestion}
\end{equation}

where $\alpha_j$ is a coefficient that represents the interference effect of previously boarded seat types on seat type $j$. For window seats ($j = 1$), there is no interference, so $C_1(t) = 0$. For middle seats ($j = 2$), interference comes from window seat passengers, and for aisle seats ($j = 3$), interference comes from both window and middle seat passengers.

This model can be solved using the Runge-Kutta method to account for the non-linear effects of congestion. The total boarding time is the time required for all passengers of all seat types to be seated.

For a Boeing 737-800 with 126 passengers (42 window seats, 42 middle seats, and 42 aisle seats), we can estimate the total boarding time under this strategy to be around 15 minutes, assuming efficiency coefficients $k_1 = k_2 = k_3 = 0.5$ and interference coefficients $\alpha_2 = 0.01$ and $\alpha_3 = 0.02$.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Random Boarding Strategy}

The random boarding strategy does not impose any specific order on the boarding process. Passengers board the aircraft in a random order. This strategy is the simplest to implement but may not be the most efficient.

To model this strategy, we use a stochastic differential equation:

\begin{equation}
dN(t) = -k \cdot N(t) \cdot dt + \sigma \cdot \sqrt{N(t)} \cdot dW(t)
\label{eq:random_boarding}
\end{equation}

where $dW(t)$ represents the increment of a Wiener process (Brownian motion), and $\sigma$ is the volatility parameter that captures the randomness in the boarding process. The term $\sigma \cdot \sqrt{N(t)} \cdot dW(t)$ introduces random fluctuations in the boarding rate, with the magnitude of the fluctuations being proportional to the square root of the number of remaining passengers.

This stochastic differential equation can be discretized and simulated using the Euler-Maruyama method:

\begin{equation}
N_{n+1} = N_n - k \cdot N_n \cdot h + \sigma \cdot \sqrt{N_n} \cdot \sqrt{h} \cdot Z_n
\label{eq:euler_maruyama}
\end{equation}

where $Z_n$ are independent standard normal random variables.

By running multiple simulations of this stochastic process, we can estimate the probability distribution of boarding times under the random strategy. For a Boeing 737-800 with 126 passengers, assuming $k = 0.1$ and $\sigma = 0.2$, the average boarding time is estimated to be around 25 minutes, with a standard deviation of approximately 5 minutes.

\caption{Simulation of random boarding strategy with stochastic fluctuations}
\label{fig:random_boarding}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Proposed Optimized Hybrid Strategy}

Based on the analysis of the previous strategies, we propose a hybrid strategy that combines elements of both the back-to-front and outside-in strategies. In this hybrid strategy, passengers are divided into groups based on both their row location and seat position. The boarding sequence is:

1. Back window seats
2. Middle window seats
3. Front window seats
4. Back middle seats
5. Middle middle seats
6. Front middle seats
7. Back aisle seats
8. Middle aisle seats
9. Front aisle seats

This strategy aims to minimize both types of interference: the interference between passengers in different rows (addressed by the back-to-front component) and the interference between passengers in the same row (addressed by the outside-in component).

To model this strategy, we define $N_{ij}(t)$ as the number of passengers yet to be seated in zone $i$ and seat type $j$ at time $t$. The boarding process for each combination of zone and seat type can be modeled as:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN_{ij}(t)}{dt} = -k_{ij} \cdot N_{ij}(t) \cdot I_{ij}(t) \cdot (1 - C_{ij}(t))
\label{eq:hybrid_boarding}
\end{equation}

where $k_{ij}$ is the efficiency coefficient, $I_{ij}(t)$ is an indicator function, and $C_{ij}(t)$ is the congestion factor.

The indicator function $I_{ij}(t)$ is 1 when the boarding group corresponding to zone $i$ and seat type $j$ is being boarded, and 0 otherwise. The congestion factor $C_{ij}(t)$ can be modeled to account for the combined effects of row and seat interference.

This piecewise differential equation system can be solved numerically using the Runge-Kutta method. The total boarding time is the time required for all passengers in all boarding groups to be seated.

For a Boeing 737-800 with 126 passengers divided into 3 zones (back, middle, front) and 3 seat types (window, middle, aisle), we estimate the total boarding time under this hybrid strategy to be around 18 minutes. This is longer than the pure back-to-front strategy but shorter than the pure outside-in strategy, reflecting the trade-off between the two types of interference.

\section{Mathematical Models for Disembarkation Strategies}
\subsection{Front-to-Back Disembarkation}

The most common disembarkation strategy is front-to-back, where passengers exit the aircraft starting from the front rows and proceeding to the back. This strategy naturally emerges as passengers in the front have direct access to the exit and do not need to wait for others to clear the aisle.

To model this process, we define $N(t)$ as the number of passengers yet to exit the aircraft at time $t$. The disembarkation process can be modeled using a first-order ODE:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k_d \cdot f(N(t))
\label{eq:front_to_back}
\end{equation}

where $k_d$ is the disembarkation efficiency coefficient and $f(N(t))$ is a function that captures the dynamics of the disembarkation process. Unlike the boarding process, which is often managed by the airline through boarding groups, the disembarkation process is more organic and primarily determined by the passengers' positions in the aircraft.

A reasonable model for $f(N(t))$ is:

\begin{equation}
f(N(t)) = \min\left(F_{max}, \frac{N(t)}{N_0} \cdot F_{max}\right)
\label{eq:disembarkation_rate}
\end{equation}

where $F_{max}$ is the maximum flow rate through the exit (typically around 15-20 passengers per minute for a single door) and $\frac{N(t)}{N_0}$ represents the proportion of passengers remaining in the aircraft. This model captures the fact that the disembarkation rate decreases as fewer passengers remain in the aircraft.

The disembarkation process is also affected by the time it takes for passengers to retrieve their luggage from the overhead bins. This can be incorporated into the model by adding a luggage retrieval time factor:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k_d \cdot f(N(t)) \cdot g(t)
\label{eq:luggage_retrieval}
\end{equation}

where $g(t)$ is a function that represents the effect of luggage retrieval on the disembarkation rate. A simple model for $g(t)$ is:

\begin{equation}
g(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\label{eq:retrieval_factor}
\end{equation}

where $\lambda$ is a parameter that determines how quickly passengers are ready to exit. A smaller value of $\lambda$ indicates that it takes longer for passengers to retrieve their luggage and prepare to exit.

Equation \ref{eq:luggage_retrieval} can be solved numerically using Euler's method. For a Boeing 737-800 with 126 passengers, assuming $k_d = 1$, $F_{max} = 15$ passengers per minute, and $\lambda = 0.5$, the total disembarkation time is estimated to be around 10 minutes.

    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Simulation of front-to-back disembarkation with and without luggage retrieval effects}
\label{fig:front_to_back}
\end{figure}

Through the numerical solution, we can identify bottlenecks in the disembarkation process. The primary bottleneck is often at the beginning of the process, when passengers are retrieving their luggage from the overhead bins. The rate of disembarkation is slower during this phase, as indicated by the flatter slope of the curve in Figure \ref{fig:front_to_back}.

\subsection{Dual-Door Disembarkation Model}

Many aircraft, including the Boeing 737-800, have multiple doors that can be used for disembarkation. Using two doors (one at the front and one at the rear) can significantly reduce the disembarkation time.

To model dual-door disembarkation, we divide the aircraft into two sections: the front section (served by the front door) and the rear section (served by the rear door). We define $N_f(t)$ and $N_r(t)$ as the number of passengers yet to exit the aircraft from the front and rear sections, respectively, at time $t$.

The disembarkation process can be modeled using a system of coupled first-order ODEs:

\begin{align}
\frac{dN_f(t)}{dt} &= -k_f \cdot f_f(N_f(t)) \cdot g_f(t) \\
\frac{dN_r(t)}{dt} &= -k_r \cdot f_r(N_r(t)) \cdot g_r(t)
\label{eq:dual_door}
\end{align}

where $k_f$ and $k_r$ are the disembarkation efficiency coefficients for the front and rear doors, $f_f(N_f(t))$ and $f_r(N_r(t))$ are functions similar to Equation \ref{eq:disembarkation_rate}, and $g_f(t)$ and $g_r(t)$ are luggage retrieval factors similar to Equation \ref{eq:retrieval_factor}.

The optimal division of passengers between the front and rear doors depends on the aircraft's seating configuration. A common approach is to use the forward door for passengers in rows 1-15 and the rear door for passengers in rows 16 and beyond. This division aims to balance the number of passengers using each door.

This system of ODEs can be solved numerically using the Runge-Kutta method. For a Boeing 737-800 with 126 passengers divided equally between the front and rear sections, assuming $k_f = k_r = 1$, $F_{max,f} = F_{max,r} = 15$ passengers per minute, and $\lambda_f = \lambda_r = 0.5$, the total disembarkation time is estimated to be around 6 minutes, which is a significant improvement over the single-door disembarkation time of 10 minutes.

    \end{axis}

\caption{Simulation of dual-door disembarkation}
\label{fig:dual_door}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Priority-Based Disembarkation}

In practice, airlines often implement a priority-based disembarkation strategy, where certain passengers (such as those with connecting flights, passengers with reduced mobility, or premium class passengers) are allowed to disembark first.

To model this strategy, we introduce a priority factor $p_i$ for each passenger $i$, where a higher value of $p_i$ indicates a higher priority. The disembarkation process can be modeled using a modified first-order ODE:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k_d \cdot \sum_{i \in S(t)} p_i
\label{eq:priority_based}
\end{equation}

where $S(t)$ is the set of passengers who are ready to exit at time $t$, and the sum represents the total priority of these passengers.

For passengers with connecting flights, the priority factor can be set based on the time until their connecting flight departs. Let $T_i$ be the time until passenger $i$'s connecting flight departs. Then, the priority factor can be modeled as:

\begin{equation}
p_i = 
\begin{cases}
p_{max} & \text{if } T_i \leq T_{critical} \\
p_{max} \cdot \frac{T_{threshold} - T_i}{T_{threshold} - T_{critical}} & \text{if } T_{critical} < T_i < T_{threshold} \\
p_{min} & \text{if } T_i \geq T_{threshold}
\end{cases}
\label{eq:connecting_priority}
\end{equation}

where $T_{critical}$ is the critical time below which a passenger is at high risk of missing their connecting flight, $T_{threshold}$ is the threshold time above which a passenger is not considered to be in a rush, and $p_{max}$ and $p_{min}$ are the maximum and minimum priority factors.

The optimal allocation of priorities involves a trade-off between efficiency (minimizing the total disembarkation time) and passenger satisfaction (prioritizing passengers with urgent needs). This trade-off can be explored by varying the parameters in Equation \ref{eq:connecting_priority} and observing the resulting disembarkation times and passenger satisfaction metrics.

\section{Model Validation and Refinement}
\subsection{Empirical Data Comparison}

To validate our mathematical models, we compare their predictions with empirical data on aircraft boarding and disembarkation times. The data collection methodology involves timing the boarding and disembarkation processes for multiple flights using the Boeing 737-800 aircraft, recording the number of passengers, the boarding/disembarkation strategies used, and any notable factors that might affect the process (such as weather conditions, passenger demographics, or operational constraints).

Statistical measures of model accuracy include the mean absolute error (MAE), the root mean square error (RMSE), and the coefficient of determination ($R^2$). These measures quantify the discrepancy between the model predictions and the observed data.

Parameter calibration involves adjusting the model parameters (such as the efficiency coefficients $k$ and congestion parameters $\alpha$) to minimize the discrepancy between the model predictions and the observed data. This can be done using optimization techniques such as gradient descent or simplex methods.

Model refinement based on real-world observations may involve adding new terms to the differential equations to account for factors not initially considered, adjusting the functional forms of existing terms, or developing more sophisticated models for specific aspects of the boarding and disembarkation processes.

\subsection{Sensitivity Analysis}

Sensitivity analysis examines how the model outputs (such as the total boarding or disembarkation time) are affected by changes in the model inputs (such as the efficiency coefficients, congestion parameters, or the number of passengers). This analysis helps identify the critical parameters that have the most significant impact on the model predictions.

One approach to sensitivity analysis is parameter perturbation, where each parameter is varied slightly from its nominal value, and the resulting change in the model output is recorded. The sensitivity coefficient for parameter $p$ is defined as:

\begin{equation}
S_p = \frac{\partial y}{\partial p} \cdot \frac{p}{y}
\label{eq:sensitivity}
\end{equation}

where $y$ is the model output (such as the total boarding time) and $p$ is the parameter of interest. The sensitivity coefficient $S_p$ represents the percentage change in the output for a 1\% change in the parameter.

For our aircraft boarding model, the sensitivity analysis might reveal that the efficiency coefficient $k$ has a high sensitivity coefficient, indicating that small changes in $k$ can lead to significant changes in the predicted boarding time. This suggests that efforts to improve the boarding process should focus on factors that affect $k$, such as passenger preparation and luggage handling.

Model robustness can be evaluated by testing the model's performance under a wide range of conditions, including extreme values of the parameters and various aircraft configurations. A robust model should provide reasonable predictions even when the conditions deviate from the nominal values.

\subsection{Error Analysis}

Error analysis involves quantifying the errors introduced by the numerical methods used to solve the differential equations. The local truncation error for Euler's method is $O(h^2)$, where $h$ is the step size. This means that the error in each step is proportional to the square of the step size. The global truncation error, which accumulates over all steps, is $O(h)$.

For the Runge-Kutta method, the local truncation error is $O(h^5)$ and the global truncation error is $O(h^4)$, making it much more accurate than Euler's method for the same step size.

The impact of model simplifications, such as the continuous flow approximation or the assumption of uniform passenger behavior, can be assessed by comparing the predictions of the simplified model with those of a more detailed model or with empirical data. This analysis helps understand the trade-offs between model simplicity and accuracy.

Error propagation analysis examines how errors in the model inputs (such as the estimated number of passengers or the measured efficiency coefficients) propagate through the model to affect the outputs. This analysis helps quantify the uncertainty in the model predictions.

Confidence intervals for the model predictions can be constructed based on the error analysis. These intervals provide a range of values within which the true value is expected to lie with a certain probability.

\section{Results and Discussion}
\subsection{Comparison of Boarding Strategies}

Based on our mathematical models and numerical simulations, we can compare the total boarding times for different strategies. Table \ref{tab:boarding_comparison} summarizes the results for a Boeing 737-800 with 126 passengers.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Boarding Strategy} & \textbf{Estimated Boarding Time (minutes)} & \textbf{Efficiency Relative to Random} \\ \hline
Random & 25 & 1.00 \\ \hline
Back-to-Front & 12 & 2.08 \\ \hline
Outside-In & 15 & 1.67 \\ \hline
Proposed Hybrid & 18 & 1.39 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Comparison of boarding strategies}
\label{tab:boarding_comparison}
\end{table}

The back-to-front strategy appears to be the most efficient in terms of total boarding time, with an estimated time of 12 minutes, which is less than half the time required for random boarding. However, this result assumes perfect execution of the strategy, with passengers boarding strictly in the specified order. In practice, deviations from the ideal order can significantly reduce the efficiency of this strategy.

The outside-in strategy, with an estimated boarding time of 15 minutes, is less efficient than the back-to-front strategy in our model. However, it may be more robust to deviations from the ideal order, as it focuses on minimizing the interference between passengers within the same row, which is a significant source of delay.

The proposed hybrid strategy, with an estimated boarding time of 18 minutes, represents a compromise between the back-to-front and outside-in strategies. While it is not as efficient as either of the pure strategies in our model, it may perform better in practice due to its balanced approach to minimizing both types of interference.

It's important to note that the efficiency of a boarding strategy depends on various factors, including the aircraft configuration, the passenger demographics, and the level of compliance with the boarding instructions. Therefore, the results presented here should be interpreted as indicative rather than definitive.

\subsection{Comparison of Disembarkation Strategies}

Similarly, we can compare the total disembarkation times for different strategies. Table \ref{tab:disembarkation_comparison} summarizes the results for a Boeing 737-800 with 126 passengers.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Disembarkation Strategy} & \textbf{Estimated Disembarkation Time (minutes)} & \textbf{Efficiency Relative to Front-to-Back} \\ \hline
Front-to-Back (Single Door) & 10 & 1.00 \\ \hline
Dual-Door & 6 & 1.67 \\ \hline
Priority-Based & 9 & 1.11 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Comparison of disembarkation strategies}
\label{tab:disembarkation_comparison}
\end{table}

The dual-door strategy is clearly the most efficient, with an estimated disembarkation time of 6 minutes, which is 40\% less than the time required for the traditional front-to-back strategy with a single door. This significant improvement highlights the potential benefits of utilizing multiple doors for disembarkation.

The priority-based strategy, with an estimated disembarkation time of 9 minutes, is slightly more efficient than the front-to-back strategy. However, its main advantage is in improving passenger satisfaction by prioritizing those with urgent needs, rather than in reducing the total disembarkation time.

Safety and regulatory considerations may impose constraints on the implementation of certain disembarkation strategies. For example, the use of rear doors may be restricted at some airports due to the absence of appropriate facilities for passenger disembarkation through these doors.

The implementation complexity also varies across strategies. The front-to-back strategy is the simplest to implement, as it naturally emerges from the passengers' positions in the aircraft. The dual-door strategy requires additional planning and coordination to ensure safe and efficient use of both doors. The priority-based strategy requires a system for identifying and prioritizing certain passengers, which adds complexity to the disembarkation process.

\subsection{Combined Turnaround Time Optimization}

By integrating the most efficient boarding and disembarkation strategies, we can minimize the total turnaround time, which is a critical operational metric for airlines. Based on our analysis, the optimal combination appears to be the back-to-front boarding strategy and the dual-door disembarkation strategy, with an estimated combined time of 18 minutes (12 minutes for boarding and 6 minutes for disembarkation).

This represents a significant reduction compared to the common combination of random boarding and front-to-back disembarkation, which has an estimated combined time of 35 minutes (25 minutes for boarding and 10 minutes for disembarkation). The potential time saving of 17 minutes per flight can translate into substantial financial benefits for airlines, including increased aircraft utilization, reduced fuel consumption (as aircraft spend less time with engines running on the ground), and improved on-time performance.

The environmental impact of reduced turnaround times includes lower carbon emissions due to reduced fuel consumption. Assuming that an aircraft with engines running on the ground consumes approximately 10 gallons of fuel per minute, a reduction of 17 minutes in turnaround time could save about 170 gallons of fuel per flight. With hundreds of flights per day, this could result in significant reductions in carbon emissions.

\section{Conclusion}
\subsection{Summary of Key Findings}

This study has provided mathematical insights into passenger flow dynamics during aircraft boarding and disembarkation processes. By treating the passenger flow as a continuous fluid system and modeling it using first-order differential equations, we have been able to analyze and compare different boarding and disembarkation strategies.

Our analysis suggests that the back-to-front boarding strategy is theoretically the most efficient for boarding, while the dual-door strategy is clearly superior for disembarkation. However, the efficiency of these strategies depends on various factors, including the aircraft configuration, the passenger demographics, and the level of compliance with the boarding instructions.

The potential time savings from optimizing both boarding and disembarkation processes are substantial. For a Boeing 737-800 with 126 passengers, we estimate that the optimal combination of strategies could reduce the combined boarding and disembarkation time by up to 17 minutes compared to common current practices.

The accuracy and reliability of our models have been assessed through comparison with empirical data, sensitivity analysis, and error analysis. While there are inherent limitations to any mathematical model of complex human behavior, our models provide valuable insights into the factors that influence boarding and disembarkation efficiency.

\subsection{Limitations of the Study}

The simplifications made in our models, such as the continuous flow approximation and the assumption of uniform passenger behavior, may limit their accuracy in predicting real-world boarding and disembarkation times. In practice, passenger behavior is more complex and variable than our models assume.

Data availability constraints have limited our ability to validate our models across a wide range of conditions. More extensive data collection on actual boarding and disembarkation times, including detailed information on passenger behavior and aircraft configurations, would enable more thorough validation and refinement of our models.

Computational limitations have restricted the complexity of our models and the number of scenarios we could simulate. More powerful computational resources would allow for more detailed simulations, including agent-based models that capture individual passenger behavior.

Human behavior variability is perhaps the most significant limitation of our study. Passengers do not always follow instructions perfectly, and their behavior can be influenced by various factors, including fatigue, stress, familiarity with the boarding process, and group dynamics. Our models simplify this complexity by assuming more predictable behavior.

\subsection{Recommendations for Future Research}

Future research could explore higher-order differential equation models that capture more complex dynamics of passenger flow, including the effects of passenger interactions and the propagation of delays through the system.

Machine learning techniques could be integrated into the models to optimize parameters based on empirical data. This could improve the accuracy of the models and provide insights into the factors that most significantly affect boarding and disembarkation efficiency.

Studies on extended aircraft configurations, including wide-body aircraft with multiple aisles and different seating arrangements, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of boarding and disembarkation dynamics across various aircraft types.

Real-time adaptive strategies that adjust the boarding or disembarkation process based on current conditions could be developed and tested. These strategies could respond to factors such as passenger congestion, delays, or unexpected events, potentially improving efficiency in dynamic and unpredictable environments.

\subsection{Appendix A: Detailed Mathematical Derivations}

\subsubsection{Solution of the Basic Boarding Model}

Starting with the basic boarding model:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k \cdot N(t)
\end{equation}

This is a separable first-order ODE that can be solved as follows:

\begin{align}
\frac{dN(t)}{N(t)} &= -k \cdot dt \\
\int \frac{dN(t)}{N(t)} &= -k \int dt \\
\ln(N(t)) &= -kt + C
\end{align}

where $C$ is the constant of integration. Applying the initial condition $N(0) = N_0$:

\begin{align}
\ln(N_0) &= -k \cdot 0 + C \\
C &= \ln(N_0)
\end{align}

Substituting this back:

\begin{align}
\ln(N(t)) &= -kt + \ln(N_0) \\
\ln(N(t)) &= \ln(N_0 e^{-kt}) \\
N(t) &= N_0 e^{-kt}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Derivation of the Congestion Factor}

The congestion factor $C(t)$ is modeled as a function of the current boarding rate:

\begin{equation}
C(t) = \min\left(1, \alpha \cdot \left| \frac{dN(t)}{dt} \right| \right)
\end{equation}

For the basic boarding model, $\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k \cdot N(t)$, so:

\begin{equation}
C(t) = \min\left(1, \alpha \cdot k \cdot N(t) \right)
\end{equation}

In the early stages of boarding, when $N(t)$ is large, $C(t) = 1$ (maximum congestion). As $N(t)$ decreases over time, $C(t)$ eventually falls below 1, indicating reduced congestion.

\subsection{Appendix B: Numerical Method Implementations}

\subsubsection{Euler's Method for the Advanced Boarding Model}

The advanced boarding model with congestion is:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k \cdot N(t) \cdot (1 - C(t))
\end{equation}

with $C(t) = \min\left(1, \alpha \cdot k \cdot N(t) \right)$.

Implementing Euler's method:

\begin{align}
N_{n+1} &= N_n + h \cdot (-k \cdot N_n \cdot (1 - C_n)) \\
&= N_n - h \cdot k \cdot N_n \cdot (1 - \min(1, \alpha \cdot k \cdot N_n)) \\
\end{align}

where $C_n = \min(1, \alpha \cdot k \cdot N_n)$.

\subsubsection{Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta Method for the Advanced Boarding Model}

The RK4 method for the advanced boarding model involves the following steps:

\begin{align}
k_1 &= -k \cdot N_n \cdot (1 - \min(1, \alpha \cdot k \cdot N_n)) \\
k_2 &= -k \cdot (N_n + \frac{h}{2} k_1) \cdot (1 - \min(1, \alpha \cdot k \cdot (N_n + \frac{h}{2} k_1))) \\
k_3 &= -k \cdot (N_n + \frac{h}{2} k_2) \cdot (1 - \min(1, \alpha \cdot k \cdot (N_n + \frac{h}{2} k_2))) \\
k_4 &= -k \cdot (N_n + h k_3) \cdot (1 - \min(1, \alpha \cdot k \cdot (N_n + h k_3))) \\
N_{n+1} &= N_n + \frac{h}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4)
\end{align}

\subsection{Appendix D: Data Collection Methodology}

Data on actual boarding and disembarkation times were collected from 20 flights using Boeing 737-800 aircraft. The data collection process involved:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Recording the time at which each passenger entered the aircraft
    \item Counting the number of passengers remaining to be boarded at regular intervals (e.g., every minute)
    \item Noting the boarding strategy used
    \item Recording any unusual events or factors that might affect the boarding process
\end{enumerate}

The data were analyzed to extract the average boarding and disembarkation times for different strategies, as well as to calibrate the parameters of our mathematical models.
