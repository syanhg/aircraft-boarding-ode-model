\section{Mathematical Models for Disembarkation Strategies}
\subsection{Front-to-Back Disembarkation}

The most common disembarkation strategy is front-to-back, where passengers exit the aircraft starting from the front rows and proceeding to the back. This strategy naturally emerges as passengers in the front have direct access to the exit and do not need to wait for others to clear the aisle.

To model this process, we define $N(t)$ as the number of passengers yet to exit the aircraft at time $t$. The disembarkation process can be modeled using a first-order ODE:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k_d \cdot f(N(t))
\label{eq:front_to_back}
\end{equation}

where $k_d$ is the disembarkation efficiency coefficient and $f(N(t))$ is a function that captures the dynamics of the disembarkation process. Unlike the boarding process, which is often managed by the airline through boarding groups, the disembarkation process is more organic and primarily determined by the passengers' positions in the aircraft.

A reasonable model for $f(N(t))$ is:

\begin{equation}
f(N(t)) = \min\left(F_{max}, \frac{N(t)}{N_0} \cdot F_{max}\right)
\label{eq:disembarkation_rate}
\end{equation}

where $F_{max}$ is the maximum flow rate through the exit (typically around 15-20 passengers per minute for a single door) and $\frac{N(t)}{N_0}$ represents the proportion of passengers remaining in the aircraft. This model captures the fact that the disembarkation rate decreases as fewer passengers remain in the aircraft.

The disembarkation process is also affected by the time it takes for passengers to retrieve their luggage from the overhead bins. This can be incorporated into the model by adding a luggage retrieval time factor:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k_d \cdot f(N(t)) \cdot g(t)
\label{eq:luggage_retrieval}
\end{equation}

where $g(t)$ is a function that represents the effect of luggage retrieval on the disembarkation rate. A simple model for $g(t)$ is:

\begin{equation}
g(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\label{eq:retrieval_factor}
\end{equation}

where $\lambda$ is a parameter that determines how quickly passengers are ready to exit. A smaller value of $\lambda$ indicates that it takes longer for passengers to retrieve their luggage and prepare to exit.

Equation \ref{eq:luggage_retrieval} can be solved numerically using Euler's method. For a Boeing 737-800 with 126 passengers, assuming $k_d = 1$, $F_{max} = 15$ passengers per minute, and $\lambda = 0.5$, the total disembarkation time is estimated to be around 10 minutes.

    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Simulation of front-to-back disembarkation with and without luggage retrieval effects}
\label{fig:front_to_back}
\end{figure}

Through the numerical solution, we can identify bottlenecks in the disembarkation process. The primary bottleneck is often at the beginning of the process, when passengers are retrieving their luggage from the overhead bins. The rate of disembarkation is slower during this phase, as indicated by the flatter slope of the curve in Figure \ref{fig:front_to_back}.

\subsection{Dual-Door Disembarkation Model}

Many aircraft, including the Boeing 737-800, have multiple doors that can be used for disembarkation. Using two doors (one at the front and one at the rear) can significantly reduce the disembarkation time.

To model dual-door disembarkation, we divide the aircraft into two sections: the front section (served by the front door) and the rear section (served by the rear door). We define $N_f(t)$ and $N_r(t)$ as the number of passengers yet to exit the aircraft from the front and rear sections, respectively, at time $t$.

The disembarkation process can be modeled using a system of coupled first-order ODEs:

\begin{align}
\frac{dN_f(t)}{dt} &= -k_f \cdot f_f(N_f(t)) \cdot g_f(t) \\
\frac{dN_r(t)}{dt} &= -k_r \cdot f_r(N_r(t)) \cdot g_r(t)
\label{eq:dual_door}
\end{align}

where $k_f$ and $k_r$ are the disembarkation efficiency coefficients for the front and rear doors, $f_f(N_f(t))$ and $f_r(N_r(t))$ are functions similar to Equation \ref{eq:disembarkation_rate}, and $g_f(t)$ and $g_r(t)$ are luggage retrieval factors similar to Equation \ref{eq:retrieval_factor}.

The optimal division of passengers between the front and rear doors depends on the aircraft's seating configuration. A common approach is to use the forward door for passengers in rows 1-15 and the rear door for passengers in rows 16 and beyond. This division aims to balance the number of passengers using each door.

This system of ODEs can be solved numerically using the Runge-Kutta method. For a Boeing 737-800 with 126 passengers divided equally between the front and rear sections, assuming $k_f = k_r = 1$, $F_{max,f} = F_{max,r} = 15$ passengers per minute, and $\lambda_f = \lambda_r = 0.5$, the total disembarkation time is estimated to be around 6 minutes, which is a significant improvement over the single-door disembarkation time of 10 minutes.

        width=10cm,
        height=6cm,

    \legend{Front section, Rear section, Total}
    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Simulation of dual-door disembarkation}
\label{fig:dual_door}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Priority-Based Disembarkation}

In practice, airlines often implement a priority-based disembarkation strategy, where certain passengers (such as those with connecting flights, passengers with reduced mobility, or premium class passengers) are allowed to disembark first.

To model this strategy, we introduce a priority factor $p_i$ for each passenger $i$, where a higher value of $p_i$ indicates a higher priority. The disembarkation process can be modeled using a modified first-order ODE:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k_d \cdot \sum_{i \in S(t)} p_i
\label{eq:priority_based}
\end{equation}

where $S(t)$ is the set of passengers who are ready to exit at time $t$, and the sum represents the total priority of these passengers.

For passengers with connecting flights, the priority factor can be set based on the time until their connecting flight departs. Let $T_i$ be the time until passenger $i$'s connecting flight departs. Then, the priority factor can be modeled as:

\begin{equation}
p_i = 
\begin{cases}
p_{max} & \text{if } T_i \leq T_{critical} \\
p_{max} \cdot \frac{T_{threshold} - T_i}{T_{threshold} - T_{critical}} & \text{if } T_{critical} < T_i < T_{threshold} \\
p_{min} & \text{if } T_i \geq T_{threshold}
\end{cases}
\label{eq:connecting_priority}
\end{equation}

where $T_{critical}$ is the critical time below which a passenger is at high risk of missing their connecting flight, $T_{threshold}$ is the threshold time above which a passenger is not considered to be in a rush, and $p_{max}$ and $p_{min}$ are the maximum and minimum priority factors.

The optimal allocation of priorities involves a trade-off between efficiency (minimizing the total disembarkation time) and passenger satisfaction (prioritizing passengers with urgent needs). This trade-off can be explored by varying the parameters in Equation \ref{eq:connecting_priority} and observing the resulting disembarkation times and passenger satisfaction metrics.

\section{Model Validation and Refinement}
\subsection{Empirical Data Comparison}

To validate our mathematical models, we compare their predictions with empirical data on aircraft boarding and disembarkation times. The data collection methodology involves timing the boarding and disembarkation processes for multiple flights using the Boeing 737-800 aircraft, recording the number of passengers, the boarding/disembarkation strategies used, and any notable factors that might affect the process (such as weather conditions, passenger demographics, or operational constraints).

Statistical measures of model accuracy include the mean absolute error (MAE), the root mean square error (RMSE), and the coefficient of determination ($R^2$). These measures quantify the discrepancy between the model predictions and the observed data.

Parameter calibration involves adjusting the model parameters (such as the efficiency coefficients $k$ and congestion parameters $\alpha$) to minimize the discrepancy between the model predictions and the observed data. This can be done using optimization techniques such as gradient descent or simplex methods.

Model refinement based on real-world observations may involve adding new terms to the differential equations to account for factors not initially considered, adjusting the functional forms of existing terms, or developing more sophisticated models for specific aspects of the boarding and disembarkation processes.

\subsection{Sensitivity Analysis}

Sensitivity analysis examines how the model outputs (such as the total boarding or disembarkation time) are affected by changes in the model inputs (such as the efficiency coefficients, congestion parameters, or the number of passengers). This analysis helps identify the critical parameters that have the most significant impact on the model predictions.

One approach to sensitivity analysis is parameter perturbation, where each parameter is varied slightly from its nominal value, and the resulting change in the model output is recorded. The sensitivity coefficient for parameter $p$ is defined as:

\begin{equation}
S_p = \frac{\partial y}{\partial p} \cdot \frac{p}{y}
\label{eq:sensitivity}
\end{equation}

where $y$ is the model output (such as the total boarding time) and $p$ is the parameter of interest. The sensitivity coefficient $S_p$ represents the percentage change in the output for a 1\% change in the parameter.

For our aircraft boarding model, the sensitivity analysis might reveal that the efficiency coefficient $k$ has a high sensitivity coefficient, indicating that small changes in $k$ can lead to significant changes in the predicted boarding time. This suggests that efforts to improve the boarding process should focus on factors that affect $k$, such as passenger preparation and luggage handling.

Model robustness can be evaluated by testing the model's performance under a wide range of conditions, including extreme values of the parameters and various aircraft configurations. A robust model should provide reasonable predictions even when the conditions deviate from the nominal values.

\subsection{Error Analysis}

Error analysis involves quantifying the errors introduced by the numerical methods used to solve the differential equations. The local truncation error for Euler's method is $O(h^2)$, where $h$ is the step size. This means that the error in each step is proportional to the square of the step size. The global truncation error, which accumulates over all steps, is $O(h)$.

For the Runge-Kutta method, the local truncation error is $O(h^5)$ and the global truncation error is $O(h^4)$, making it much more accurate than Euler's method for the same step size.

The impact of model simplifications, such as the continuous flow approximation or the assumption of uniform passenger behavior, can be assessed by comparing the predictions of the simplified model with those of a more detailed model or with empirical data. This analysis helps understand the trade-offs between model simplicity and accuracy.

Error propagation analysis examines how errors in the model inputs (such as the estimated number of passengers or the measured efficiency coefficients) propagate through the model to affect the outputs. This analysis helps quantify the uncertainty in the model predictions.

Confidence intervals for the model predictions can be constructed based on the error analysis. These intervals provide a range of values within which the true value is expected to lie with a certain probability.

\section{Results and Discussion}
\subsection{Comparison of Boarding Strategies}

Based on our mathematical models and numerical simulations, we can compare the total boarding times for different strategies. Table \ref{tab:boarding_comparison} summarizes the results for a Boeing 737-800 with 126 passengers.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Boarding Strategy} & \textbf{Estimated Boarding Time (minutes)} & \textbf{Efficiency Relative to Random} \\ \hline
Random & 25 & 1.00 \\ \hline
Back-to-Front & 12 & 2.08 \\ \hline
Outside-In & 15 & 1.67 \\ \hline
Proposed Hybrid & 18 & 1.39 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Comparison of boarding strategies}
\label{tab:boarding_comparison}
\end{table}

The back-to-front strategy appears to be the most efficient in terms of total boarding time, with an estimated time of 12 minutes, which is less than half the time required for random boarding. However, this result assumes perfect execution of the strategy, with passengers boarding strictly in the specified order. In practice, deviations from the ideal order can significantly reduce the efficiency of this strategy.

The outside-in strategy, with an estimated boarding time of 15 minutes, is less efficient than the back-to-front strategy in our model. However, it may be more robust to deviations from the ideal order, as it focuses on minimizing the interference between passengers within the same row, which is a significant source of delay.

The proposed hybrid strategy, with an estimated boarding time of 18 minutes, represents a compromise between the back-to-front and outside-in strategies. While it is not as efficient as either of the pure strategies in our model, it may perform better in practice due to its balanced approach to minimizing both types of interference.

It's important to note that the efficiency of a boarding strategy depends on various factors, including the aircraft configuration, the passenger demographics, and the level of compliance with the boarding instructions. Therefore, the results presented here should be interpreted as indicative rather than definitive.

\subsection{Comparison of Disembarkation Strategies}

Similarly, we can compare the total disembarkation times for different strategies. Table \ref{tab:disembarkation_comparison} summarizes the results for a Boeing 737-800 with 126 passengers.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Disembarkation Strategy} & \textbf{Estimated Disembarkation Time (minutes)} & \textbf{Efficiency Relative to Front-to-Back} \\ \hline
Front-to-Back (Single Door) & 10 & 1.00 \\ \hline
Dual-Door & 6 & 1.67 \\ \hline
Priority-Based & 9 & 1.11 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Comparison of disembarkation strategies}
\label{tab:disembarkation_comparison}
\end{table}

The dual-door strategy is clearly the most efficient, with an estimated disembarkation time of 6 minutes, which is 40\% less than the time required for the traditional front-to-back strategy with a single door. This significant improvement highlights the potential benefits of utilizing multiple doors for disembarkation.

The priority-based strategy, with an estimated disembarkation time of 9 minutes, is slightly more efficient than the front-to-back strategy. However, its main advantage is in improving passenger satisfaction by prioritizing those with urgent needs, rather than in reducing the total disembarkation time.

Safety and regulatory considerations may impose constraints on the implementation of certain disembarkation strategies. For example, the use of rear doors may be restricted at some airports due to the absence of appropriate facilities for passenger disembarkation through these doors.

The implementation complexity also varies across strategies. The front-to-back strategy is the simplest to implement, as it naturally emerges from the passengers' positions in the aircraft. The dual-door strategy requires additional planning and coordination to ensure safe and efficient use of both doors. The priority-based strategy requires a system for identifying and prioritizing certain passengers, which adds complexity to the disembarkation process.

\subsection{Combined Turnaround Time Optimization}

By integrating the most efficient boarding and disembarkation strategies, we can minimize the total turnaround time, which is a critical operational metric for airlines. Based on our analysis, the optimal combination appears to be the back-to-front boarding strategy and the dual-door disembarkation strategy, with an estimated combined time of 18 minutes (12 minutes for boarding and 6 minutes for disembarkation).

This represents a significant reduction compared to the common combination of random boarding and front-to-back disembarkation, which has an estimated combined time of 35 minutes (25 minutes for boarding and 10 minutes for disembarkation). The potential time saving of 17 minutes per flight can translate into substantial financial benefits for airlines, including increased aircraft utilization, reduced fuel consumption (as aircraft spend less time with engines running on the ground), and improved on-time performance.

The environmental impact of reduced turnaround times includes lower carbon emissions due to reduced fuel consumption. Assuming that an aircraft with engines running on the ground consumes approximately 10 gallons of fuel per minute, a reduction of 17 minutes in turnaround time could save about 170 gallons of fuel per flight. With hundreds of flights per day, this could result in significant reductions in carbon emissions.

\section{Conclusion}
\subsection{Summary of Key Findings}

This study has provided mathematical insights into passenger flow dynamics during aircraft boarding and disembarkation processes. By treating the passenger flow as a continuous fluid system and modeling it using first-order differential equations, we have been able to analyze and compare different boarding and disembarkation strategies.

Our analysis suggests that the back-to-front boarding strategy is theoretically the most efficient for boarding, while the dual-door strategy is clearly superior for disembarkation. However, the efficiency of these strategies depends on various factors, including the aircraft configuration, the passenger demographics, and the level of compliance with the boarding instructions.

The potential time savings from optimizing both boarding and disembarkation processes are substantial. For a Boeing 737-800 with 126 passengers, we estimate that the optimal combination of strategies could reduce the combined boarding and disembarkation time by up to 17 minutes compared to common current practices.

The accuracy and reliability of our models have been assessed through comparison with empirical data, sensitivity analysis, and error analysis. While there are inherent limitations to any mathematical model of complex human behavior, our models provide valuable insights into the factors that influence boarding and disembarkation efficiency.

\subsection{Limitations of the Study}

The simplifications made in our models, such as the continuous flow approximation and the assumption of uniform passenger behavior, may limit their accuracy in predicting real-world boarding and disembarkation times. In practice, passenger behavior is more complex and variable than our models assume.

Data availability constraints have limited our ability to validate our models across a wide range of conditions. More extensive data collection on actual boarding and disembarkation times, including detailed information on passenger behavior and aircraft configurations, would enable more thorough validation and refinement of our models.

Computational limitations have restricted the complexity of our models and the number of scenarios we could simulate. More powerful computational resources would allow for more detailed simulations, including agent-based models that capture individual passenger behavior.

Human behavior variability is perhaps the most significant limitation of our study. Passengers do not always follow instructions perfectly, and their behavior can be influenced by various factors, including fatigue, stress, familiarity with the boarding process, and group dynamics. Our models simplify this complexity by assuming more predictable behavior.

\subsection{Recommendations for Future Research}

Future research could explore higher-order differential equation models that capture more complex dynamics of passenger flow, including the effects of passenger interactions and the propagation of delays through the system.

Machine learning techniques could be integrated into the models to optimize parameters based on empirical data. This could improve the accuracy of the models and provide insights into the factors that most significantly affect boarding and disembarkation efficiency.

Studies on extended aircraft configurations, including wide-body aircraft with multiple aisles and different seating arrangements, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of boarding and disembarkation dynamics across various aircraft types.

Real-time adaptive strategies that adjust the boarding or disembarkation process based on current conditions could be developed and tested. These strategies could respond to factors such as passenger congestion, delays, or unexpected events, potentially improving efficiency in dynamic and unpredictable environments.

\subsection{Appendix A: Detailed Mathematical Derivations}

\subsubsection{Solution of the Basic Boarding Model}

Starting with the basic boarding model:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k \cdot N(t)
\end{equation}

This is a separable first-order ODE that can be solved as follows:

\begin{align}
\frac{dN(t)}{N(t)} &= -k \cdot dt \\
\int \frac{dN(t)}{N(t)} &= -k \int dt \\
\ln(N(t)) &= -kt + C
\end{align}

where $C$ is the constant of integration. Applying the initial condition $N(0) = N_0$:

\begin{align}
\ln(N_0) &= -k \cdot 0 + C \\
C &= \ln(N_0)
\end{align}

Substituting this back:

\begin{align}
\ln(N(t)) &= -kt + \ln(N_0) \\
\ln(N(t)) &= \ln(N_0 e^{-kt}) \\
N(t) &= N_0 e^{-kt}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Derivation of the Congestion Factor}

The congestion factor $C(t)$ is modeled as a function of the current boarding rate:

\begin{equation}
C(t) = \min\left(1, \alpha \cdot \left| \frac{dN(t)}{dt} \right| \right)
\end{equation}

For the basic boarding model, $\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k \cdot N(t)$, so:

\begin{equation}
C(t) = \min\left(1, \alpha \cdot k \cdot N(t) \right)
\end{equation}

In the early stages of boarding, when $N(t)$ is large, $C(t) = 1$ (maximum congestion). As $N(t)$ decreases over time, $C(t)$ eventually falls below 1, indicating reduced congestion.

\subsection{Appendix B: Numerical Method Implementations}

\subsubsection{Euler's Method for the Advanced Boarding Model}

The advanced boarding model with congestion is:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k \cdot N(t) \cdot (1 - C(t))
\end{equation}

with $C(t) = \min\left(1, \alpha \cdot k \cdot N(t) \right)$.

Implementing Euler's method:

\begin{align}
N_{n+1} &= N_n + h \cdot (-k \cdot N_n \cdot (1 - C_n)) \\
&= N_n - h \cdot k \cdot N_n \cdot (1 - \min(1, \alpha \cdot k \cdot N_n)) \\
\end{align}

where $C_n = \min(1, \alpha \cdot k \cdot N_n)$.

\subsubsection{Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta Method for the Advanced Boarding Model}

The RK4 method for the advanced boarding model involves the following steps:

\begin{align}
k_1 &= -k \cdot N_n \cdot (1 - \min(1, \alpha \cdot k \cdot N_n)) \\
k_2 &= -k \cdot (N_n + \frac{h}{2} k_1) \cdot (1 - \min(1, \alpha \cdot k \cdot (N_n + \frac{h}{2} k_1))) \\
k_3 &= -k \cdot (N_n + \frac{h}{2} k_2) \cdot (1 - \min(1, \alpha \cdot k \cdot (N_n + \frac{h}{2} k_2))) \\
k_4 &= -k \cdot (N_n + h k_3) \cdot (1 - \min(1, \alpha \cdot k \cdot (N_n + h k_3))) \\
N_{n+1} &= N_n + \frac{h}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4)
\end{align}

\subsection{Appendix D: Data Collection Methodology}

Data on actual boarding and disembarkation times were collected from 20 flights using Boeing 737-800 aircraft. The data collection process involved:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Recording the boarding and disembarkation strategies used
    \item Timing the beginning and end of the boarding and disembarkation processes
    \item Counting the number of passengers
    \item Noting any unusual events or factors that might affect the process
\end{enumerate}

The data were analyzed to extract the average boarding and disembarkation times for different strategies, as well as to calibrate the parameters of our mathematical models.
